 ## Generative deep learning
 
 The artistic productions we've seen from AI so far have been fairly low quality. AI isn't anywhere close to rivaling human screenwriters, painters, and composers. But
 replacing humans was always beside the point: artificial intelligence isn't about replacing our own intelligence with something else, it's about bringing into our lives
 and work *more* intelligence - intelligence of a different kind. In many field, but especially in creative ones, AI will be used by humans as a tool to augment their own
 capabilities: more *augmented* intelligence than *artificial* intelligence.
