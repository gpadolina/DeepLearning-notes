## Deep learning for computer vision
This chapter introduces convolutional neural networks, also known as *convnets*, a type of deep-learning model almost universally used in computer vision applications.
## Introduction to convnents
A convnet takes as input tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, image_channels), not including the batch dimension.
#### The convolution operation
The fundamental difference betwen a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: *Dense* layers learn global patterns in their input feature space, whereas
convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs.

This key characteristics gives convnets two interesting properties:
