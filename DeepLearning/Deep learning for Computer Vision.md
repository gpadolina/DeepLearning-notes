## Deep learning for computer vision
This chapter introduces convolutional neural networks, also known as *convnets*, a type of deep-learning model almost universally used in computer vision applications.
## Introduction to convnents
A convnet takes as input tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, image_channels), not including the batch dimension.
#### The convolution operation
The fundamental difference betwen a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: *Dense* layers learn global patterns in their input feature space, whereas
convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs.

This key characteristics gives convnets two interesting properties:
* *The patterns they learn are translation invariant.* After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recorgnize it anywhere. A
densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This make convnets data efficient when processing images because the
*visual world is fundamentally translation invariant):* they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power.
* *They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns.* A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolutional layer will learn patterns
made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts.
