## Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning

#### Artificial intelligence
The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but that
also includes many more approaches that don't involve any learning.
#### Machine learning
Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyong "what we know how to order it to perform" and learn on its own how to perform specified task?
Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?

With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data, and out come the rules. These rules can then be applied to new data to produce
original answers. A machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed.

Machine learning is tightly related to mathematical statistics, but it differs from statistics in several important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends
to deal with large, complex datasets for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian would be impractical. As a result, machine learning, and especially
deep learning, exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory and is engineering oriented.

The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data. In other words, to learn useful representations of the input data at
hand - representations that get us closer to the expected output. Representation is a different way to look at data - to represent or encode data. Learning in the
context of machine learning, describes an automatic search process for better representations.

Technically, machine learning is searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback
signal.
