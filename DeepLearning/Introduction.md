## Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning

#### Artificial intelligence
The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but that
also includes many more approaches that don't involve any learning.
#### Machine learning
Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyong "what we know how to order it to perform" and learn on its own how to perform specified task?
Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?
