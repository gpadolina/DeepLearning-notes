## Key concepts
#### Various approaches to AI
First of all, deep learning isn't synonymous with AI or even with machine learning. *Artificial intelligence* is an ancient, broad field that can generally be defined as "all
attempts to automate cognitive processes" - in other words, the automation of thought.

*Machine learning* is a specific subfield of AI that aims at automatically developing programs (called *models*) purely from exposure to training data. This process of turning
data into a program is called *learning.*
