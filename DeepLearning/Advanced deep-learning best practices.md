## Advanced deep-learning best practices
This explores a number of powerful tools that will bring you closer to being able to develop state-of-the-art models on difficult problems. Using the Keras functional API,
you can build graph-like models, share a layer across different inputs, and use Keras models just like Python functions. Keras callbacks and the TensorBoard browser-based
visualization tool let you monitor models during training.
