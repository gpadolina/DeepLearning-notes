# Fundamentals of machine learning

## Four branches of machine learning
The three specific types of machine-learning problems: binary classification, multiclass classification, and scalar regression are all instances of *supervised learning*,
where the goal is to learn the relationship between training inputs and training targets.

#### Supervised learning
This is by far the most common case. Although supervised learning mostly consists of classfication and regression, there are more exotic variants as well.
* *Sequence generation* - Given a picture, predict a caption describing it.
* *Syntax tree prediction* Given a sentence, predict its decomposition into a syntax tree.
* *Object detection* - Given a picture, draw a bounding box around certain objects inside the picture.
* *Image segmentation* - Given a picture, draw a pixel-lvel mask on a specific object.
