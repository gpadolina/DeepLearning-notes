## Deep learning for text and sequences
This chapter explores deep-learning models that can process text (understood as sequences of word or sequences of characters), timeseries, and sequence of data in general.
The two fundamental deep-learning algorithsm for sequence processing are *recurrent neural networks* and *1D convnets*, the one-dimensional version of the 2D convents that
was covered previously.

Applications of these algorithms include:
* Document classification and timeseries classification, such as identifying the topic of an article or the author of a book
* Timeseries comparisons, such as estimating how closely related two documents or two stock tickers are
